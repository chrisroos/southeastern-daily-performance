## Intro

A simple web form that allows you to execute queries against the Southeastern daily performance.

## TODO

* Add a history of queries.
* Add an option to open queries automatically, rather than having to click the link
* Investigate most problematic services (i.e. route and departure time)
* Work out what days are missing
* Import all the data into mysql locally
* Link to the querymalarky from the github readme
