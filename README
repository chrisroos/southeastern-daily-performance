Process
=======
1. Manually convert one of the html reports to csv

2. Parse the csv file with a csv library to ensure that it's valid (or at least that each row contains the same number of columns)
   - Something like: "CSV.open('se-2010-01-27.csv', 'r').collect { |row| row.length }.uniq"
   
2. Wrap a test around the parser (that doesn't exist), asserting that the result of parsing the html report is the hand crafted csv output

To convert to CSV
=================
1. Make the heading (reason) the first column.

2. Replace /(\d\d:\d\d) / with \1, (i.e. replace the space after the time with a comma).

3. Replace / - / with ',' (i.e. replace the space-hyphen-space between origin/destination stations with a comma).

4. Separate the notes:
   - Replace / did not call/ with ',did not call'
   - Replace / delayed by/ with ',delayed by'
   - Replace / terminated at/ with ',terminated at' - NOTE. This isn't as simple because reasons are sometimes concatenated with 'and'
   - Replace / started/ with ',started' - NOTE. I thought we could replace / started at/ but I've seen an instance of /started /
   - Replace / cancelled/ with ',cancelled'
